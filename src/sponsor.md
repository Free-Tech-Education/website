## Sponsoring 'Free Tech Education' as an Individual

{:class="my-4"}
If you are an individual software developer and have struggled to become one due to lack of practical software development courses available in school/colleges/unis, then consider donating 'Free Tech Education' as a sign of appreciation so that no soon-to-become software developer has to struggle the same way you did.

{:class="my-4"}
You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor 'Free Tech Education' as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of non-profits than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.
